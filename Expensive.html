    <h3>2014 BMW i8 Concours d’Elegance Edition</h3>
    <p>
      Just one of these was made, and that means the lucky owner gets the fitted
      Louis Vuitton luggage, bespoke to this edition, all to themselves. Idea
      was to make a version of the pioneering i8 hybrid-powered supercar for
      auction at Pebble Beach, the annual West Coast celebration of high-end
      classic cars in the US, to auction for charity. Dalbergia Brown leather
      upholstery to the interior was tanned with plant extracts and the exterior
      finish was unique to this i8: winning bid £590,000 when the hammer fell.
